## About Me
I'm a passionate Computer Engineering Graduate (Alumni) from George Mason University and currently working as an **IT Security Consultant at atsec information security**.

I have a strong interest in Digital Design, Computer Architecture, FPGA/ASIC Design, SW/HW Co-Design, Cryptography, and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

ðŸ”¬ Research & Teaching Experience
    
Research Intern at the Cryptographic Engineering Research Group (CERG), where I gained hands-on experience in cryptographic hardware implementations.

Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) for 3 semesters, mentoring students in:

-ECE 545 â€“ Digital System Design with VHDL
-ECE 448 â€“ FPGA Design with VHDL Lab
-ECE 232 â€“ Digital System Design Lab

I truly enjoyed my time teaching and guiding students, especially when they challenged me with tough questions!

**Graduate Student Representative | GAPSA**
I had the honor of serving as a student representative for graduate students in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department through the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GAPSA). With the guidance of Dr. Kris Gaj, I helped represent student interests and support the graduate community.
